The E-Campus is a mobile application. It uses smartphones of android 
platform. The main objective is to develop an application that provides a smart and 
easy one-way communication between students and teachers without involvement of 
a representative.<br>

The application provides students with information regarding general notices 
and some important notices of the department / institute. Along with notices, 
students can also get notes for their syllabus through the application. Teachers enter 
marks of students’ semester examination which students can view through this 
application.<br>

We can also carry out Students’ Course Registration within this application 
through the Admin Module. An outsider can also view the history of the institute and 
understand the admission process through the Guest Module present in the 
application.<br>

The application has the four types of user:
1. Teacher 
2. Admin
3. Student
4. Guest

Each module will have own application view with respective to their type. They will 
have privilege according to their designation or their types and have rights to post 
things on application so that other users can view that if they are supposed to or 
have permission to view it
